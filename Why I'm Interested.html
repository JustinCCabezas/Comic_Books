	    <p>The main reason I like comic books is because of the character development comic
	    book creators do to their characters. Frank Miller (author of Daredevil Born Again)
	    made a huge success with Daredevil. Although he did killed of Karen Page, (love 
	    interest of Daredevil) Frank made the story not much of a hero story but more 
	    of a criminal investigation story. In the story, Daredevil has a tie on an enemy 
	    called Bullseye. Bullseye is an ex-police officer from Hell's Kitchen and knows who 
	    Daredevil is. While trying to save Karen and their newborn child. Bullseye kills 
	    Karen and kidnaps Daredevils child. Daredevil manages to save his child and realizes 
	    that this isn't a life his daughter should go through. In conclusion, he give up 
	    his daughter to a foster family and is giving a privilege to see her everyone month 
	    as uncle Matt.</p>
