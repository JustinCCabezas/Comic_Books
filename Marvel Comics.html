	    <p>Marvel Comics are great. There are so many heroes, villains, and anti-heroes that 
	    do their own special way of fighting crime on streets and taking on another alien
	    race. One of my favorite Marvel Comics Event was Civil War. Civil War was 
	    about the government forcing heroes to sign SHRA (Super Hero 
	    Regestration Act) that prevents heroes from doing their own hero work
	    and lets the government force the heroes to do whatever they wish to do. 
	    Iron-Man was on board with the registration, including other famous heroes 
	    like Captain Marvel, Wasp, She-hulk, and Stature. Captain America never agreed
	    with the act and said that every hero has their rights just like normal civilians 
	    do. Other heroes like Daredevil, Falcon, Invisible Girl, Cloak and Dagger agreed 
	    with Cap. Then when things started to stir up, the civil war began.</p>
