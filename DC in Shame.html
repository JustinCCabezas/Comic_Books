	    <p>I'm not much of a DC fan. Ever since they released their new 52 comic 
	    books, those comics went nowhere. Superman became more of a lone hero, Shazam 
	    had difficulties with his powers, and Green Lantern had more problems in 
	    space rather than problems on earth. But now that DC is doing their 
	    rebirth comics, a lot of fans are as happy as ever. I have to admit too, DC is 
	    doing well with the rebirth and their bring old characters back. I guess theres a 
	    bigger hope for them then I thought.</p>
