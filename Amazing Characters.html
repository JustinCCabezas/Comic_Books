	    <p>There are a lot of amazing characters. The only character that catches 
	    everyones eyes is Spider-man. Spider-man has been a major success to Marvel 
	    Comics. If you think about it, he's basically a teen who accidentally gets his 
	    powers from a mutated spider and develops abilities. Then when Uncle Ben dies,
	    he later wants to fallow in his Uncle's footsteps with responsibility. Spider-man
	    recently became an owner of his very own industry. With his new invention, the
	    Web Watch. He's now became the worlds number one hero.</p>
